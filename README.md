# My Portfolio

This is my first webpage that I have created.

## Functionality

This webpage acts as a portfolio for myself, David Gaither. 

It includes three sections: About Me, Work, & Contact Me. 
The nav bar links allow you to automatically scroll to the desired section. 

The Work section provides images representing coding projects that I have worked on.
The first and larger image, Horiseon Refractor, links to my first homework assignment when the image is clicked.

The Contact Me section has a list of links that allow you to contact me and allows you to view personal webpages that represent me.
